# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](https://github.com/estherthetester/ama/issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read answered questions](https://github.com/estherthetester/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I may get questions by email, Slack, in person, smoke signal, but responding to them may only help one person. This is an experiment to enable everyone to see the answers, and to collate a history of questions. 

**If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an [email](mailto:esthermaylloyd+ama@gmail.com) and I can post the question anonymously for you.

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Life. Tests. Weather. New Zealand. Anything.

#### Guidelines

- Please sanitise sensitive business information
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow

#### Other contact mediums
I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/estherthetester) and [email](mailto:esthermaylloyd+ama@gmail.com), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/kentcdodds/ama/issues/new).
